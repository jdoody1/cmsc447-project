CMSC 447 - Project

To run the application, click the green "Code" button at the top, then click "Download ZIP."
After downloading the zip file. Extract it wherever you want.
After doing that, open the folder containing all the files on VSCode.
Before we proceed, you must create an SQl server by following the steps below.
Or by just downloading XAMPP (what Atta uses) from here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
After downloading XAMPP, find and open the XAMPP control panel application.
From there, you just have to click "Start" next to Apache and MySQL to start their servers and that's literally it!
Now that you have your SQL server, you must install NodeJS from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
After downloading NodeJS, your setup is done. We are just three steps away.
All you now have to do, is first, run the 'update_db.py' script in the database folder from the terminal in VSCode.
Wait a few minutes, then in the VSCode teminal, type "node core.js".
If you have done everything correctly, you will get a message on the terminal telling you that you have connected to your server!
Now, go to your favorite browser (preferably Google Chrome) and just type "localhost:3000" at the top bar.
The application should be up and running!

For now, experiment with the app and have fun with it. New features and updates will be coming very soon.
